# openCR
Open Population Capture-Recapture

**openCR** 2.2.1 is available on CRAN. See also www.otago.ac.nz/density/openCR.html

The code here is under development.

It may be installed using
```
devtools::install_github("MurrayEfford/openCR")
```

(Installation is rather slow because of the compilation of C++ code, and produces voluminous messages).
